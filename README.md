Safe Eats puts an entire database of health inspection reports and A, B, and C grades for thousands of food establishments across Southern Nevada, including all of Las Vegas. 

The data for Safe Eats comes from the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD), which reviews food establishments at least annually. In addition to restaurants and bars, SNHD inspects school cafeterias, food trucks, caterers, grocery store kitchens, snack bars, and more. If food is prepared or served, SNHD reviews it and all of that information is included with Safe Eats.

Food establishments are expected to maintain A grades. That’s why you typically see an “A” in most restaurants. In fact, when SNHD downgrades from A, the operators have just a couple weeks to rectify problems before a re-inspection. 

But locations don’t have to show you their grades from last month or even yesterday, and that’s where Safe Eats gives you the full picture. With Safe Eats, you’ll be able to see their history of inspections, including details about what exactly has gone wrong.

## Getting the Data
When you first start Safe Eats you’ll be promoted to download the SNHD data. This first download is a big one, so it can take a couple minutes to complete. Once you have the data, though, future updates only include the information that’s changed, so they go quickly. The date of your last update is always shown in the lower right corner of your screen. You can download updates by tapping on that date or choosing “Download the latest inspection data” from Settings.

Once you have the data, Safe Eats shows you an alphabetical list. You can search and scroll through the list, limit it to just those locations near you, apply advanced filters to see just what you want, and mark your favorites. In all cases, the current number of locations in the list is always shown in the bottom right corner of your device. 

## Finding and Assessing a Location
By default, you’ll see all the restaurants and bars in Southern Nevada. If the high number of places surprises you, bear in mind that SNHD inspects all parts of food establishments separately. So, for example, a restaurant’s kitchen and bar will appear individually. Safe Eats uses icons to help you distinguish one from the other, but the category is also displayed on the third line of the every list entry.

To find something quickly you can search with the Search bar at the top of the screen. There are options for finding locations by Name, Address (including City), and ZIP code.

An A grade is shown in green, a B is yellow, and a C is orange. Occasionally you’ll also see X grades in red, which indicate that the location was closed by SNHD for major violations.

Safe Eats applies an award seal to the A badge if an establishment’s last inspection had no violations and no demerits. This “Perfect A” designation is not officially recognized by SNHD; it’s used solely by Safe Eats as a way to spotlight establishments that meet this distinction.

Above the badge in the list are as many as five colored dots that show a quick history of the location’s recent grades, from oldest to newest. You’ll see fewer than five dots for newer locations that may not have had that many inspections yet. The dots give you an at-a-glance view of a location’s performance. Five green dots and an A grade badge means the location has held a consistent A grade for at least their last six inspections. 

## Nearby Locations
When you first install Safe Eats it asks for location permission. If you granted that permission the list will show you how each restaurant is from your current location. If you tap the navigation icon at the bottom left of your device you can instantly filter the list to nearby locations. Tap the navigation icon a second time to turn off the filter or choose a wider search radius. 

Location filtering is a key feature of Safe Eats. It’s a great way to make quick decisions about places nearby that meet your quality expectations. 

If you didn’t grant Safe Eats location permission when you first installed the app you can turn it on later (or disable it) by going to your device Settings > Apps > Safe Eats.

### Favoriting Locations
For easier access to locations you visit often, swipe left in the list and tap Favorite. You can use the same process to un-favorite a location. 

### Sharing Locations
To share details about a location, including its name, address, and a brief inspection report, swipe left and tap Share. 

## Digging Into the Details
Tap on any entry in the list to see greater details about the location. There’s lots to see here, broken down into several sections. 

### Overview
The details view starts with an overview that includes the name and address of the establishment, its current grade, a grade history visualization line and a brief analysis of the history. The grade history visualization line contains segments for every inspection. The segment colors correspond to the badge colors (green for A, yellow for B, orange for C, red for X). The green segment for a “Perfect A” rating is indicated with a yellow outline.

This section shows whether the location is "Open Now" or "Closed." Tapping on this indicator reveals hours of operation.

### Additional Resources
### Filing a Complaint with SNHD 
At the top of the details view is a button for reporting issues to the Southern Nevada Health District. Tap the bullhorn icon to open links for filing a complaint with SNHD about a food establishment in either English or Spanish. If you believe that you became ill after eating at a location you can tap to file a Foodborne Illness Report. There’s also a link to call the SNHD Epidemiology Department. 

If you’re not feeling well it’s best to consult with your healthcare provider first and file your reports with SNHD later.

## Filtering 
### Show Your Favorites

### Smart Filters
Safe Eats Smart Filers are an advanced tool for quickly spotlighting important locations. The **Struggling with A** smart filter shows you only locations that have had difficulty maintaining a consistent A rating over time. The **Recently Downgraded** smart filter shows you locations that have dropped to a rating other than A or have done so recently. Other smart filters draw your attention to recently inspected locations, consistent A performers, and more.

You can combined Smart Filters with Favorites and other selections in the Filter view to home in on exactly the criteria that matters most to you.

### Filering By Grade
Normally, Safe Eats shows you all locations reviewed by SNHD. But you can limit the list to only those establishments with a specific current grade, such as A, B, C, or closed. There's also an option to see all A-graded and "Perfect A" locations at the same time. The "Perfect A" designation, which shows in the app as an A with a gold seal, indicates A-locations with no current violations or demerits. The "Perfect A" is a Safe Eats-only designation; it's not a designation from the SNHD.

As with all selections in the Filter view, you can set everything back to its defaults by pressing the Reset button at the top of the view.

### Filtering by Category
Every establishment has a category assigned to it by SNHD. Normally, Safe Eats shows all the locations with a category of Restaurant or Bar/Tavern. You can see locations assigned to other categories by selecting one from this list. Safe Eats shows the most common categories, but there's also a "More Categories" option that shows you less-frequently used assignment.

You can create a **custom category filter set** that includes multiple categories by long-pressing on any category name. Safe Eats will ask if you want to add establishments with that category assignment to your currently selected categories. You can remove a category from the custom category filter set by long-pressing on a selected category. 

As with all selections in the Filter view, you can set everything back to its defaults by pressing the Reset button at the top of the view.
