# Safe Eats Support

Welcome to the beta for **Safe Eats**, your guide to restaurant health inspections in Southern Nevada. With Safe Eats you can make better choices about where you spend your money for your meals.

Safe Eats puts an entire database health inspection reports and A, B, and C grades for thousands of food establishments across Southern Nevada, including all of Las Vegas. 

The data for Safe Eats comes from the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD), which reviews food establishments at least annually. In addition to restaurants and bars, SNHD reviews school cafeterias, food trucks, caterers, grocery store kitchens, snack bars, and more. If food is prepared or served, SNHD reviews it and all of that information is included with Safe Eats.

Food establishments are expected to maintain A grades. That’s why you typically see an “A” in most restaurants. In fact, when SNHD downgrades from A, a place has just a couple weeks to rectify problems before a re-inspection. 

But restaurants don’t have to show you their grades from last month or even yesterday, and that’s where Safe Eats comes in. Using the app, you’ll be able to see their history of inspections, including details about what exactly has gone wrong.

## How To Use Safe Eats
### Getting the Data
When you first start Safe Eats you’ll be asked to download the SNHD data. This first download is a big one, so it can take a couple minutes to complete. Once you have the data, though, future updates will download just the information that’s changed, so they will go quickly. The date of your last update is always shown in the lower right corner of your device. You can download updated by tapping on that date or choosing “Get the latest update now” from Settings.

Once you have the data, Safe Eats shows you an alphabetical list. The number of items in the list is always shown in the bottom right corner of your device. 

### Finding and Assessing a Location
By default, you’ll see all the restaurants and bars. If the number of places in the list surprises you, bear in mind that SNHD inspects all parts of food establishments separately. So, for example, a restaurant’s kitchen and bar will appear individually. Safe Eats uses icons to help you distinguish one from the other, but the category is also displayed on the third line of the every list entry.

You can scroll through that list, or search through using the Search bar at the top of the screen. When you tap in the Search bar you’ll see options for finding locations by Name, Address (including City), and ZIP code.

For each list entry you’ll see a badge showing the current grade for the location. An A grade is shown in green, a B is shown in yellow, and a C is shown in orange. Occasionally you’ll also see X grades in red, which indicate that the location was closed by SNHD for major violations. 

Safe Eats applies an award seal to the A badge if an establishment’s last inspection had no violations and no demerits. This “Perfect A” designation is not officially recognized by SNHD; it’s used solely by Safe Eats as a way to spotlight establishments that meet this distinction.

Above the badge in the list are as many as five colored dots that show a quick history of the location’s recent grades, from oldest to newest. You’ll see fewer than five dots for newer locations that may not have had that many inspections yet. The dots give you an at-a-glance view of a location’s performance. Five green dots and an A grade badge means the location has held a consistent A grade for at least their last six inspections. 

### Nearby Locations
When you first install Safe Eats it asks for location permission. If you granted that permission the list will show you how each restaurant is from your current location. If you tap the navigation icon at the bottom left of your device you can instantly filter the list to nearby locations. Tap the navigation icon a second time to turn off the filter or choose a wider search radius. 

Location filtering is a key feature of Safe Eats. It’s a great way to make quick decisions about places nearby that meet your quality expectations. 

If you didn’t grant Safe Eats location permission when you first installed the app you can turn it on later (or disable it) by going to your device Settings > Apps > Safe Eats.

#### Favoriting Locations
For easier access to locations you visit often, swipe left in the list and tap Favorite. You can use the same process to un-favorite a location. 

#### Sharing Locations
To share details about a location, including its name, address, and a brief inspection report, swipe left and tap Share. 

#### Digging Into the Details
Tap on any entry in the list to see greater details about the location. There’s lots to see here, broken down into several sections. 

#### Overview
The details view starts with an overview that includes the name and address of the establishment, its current grade, a grade history visualization line and a brief analysis of the history. The grade history visualization line contains segments for every inspection. The segment colors correspond to the badge colors (green for A, yellow for B, orange for C, red for X). The green segment for a “Perfect A” rating is indicated with a yellow outline.

#### Filing a Complaint with SNHD 
At the top of the details view is a button for reporting issues to the Southern Nevada Health District. Tap the bullhorn icon to open links for filing a complaint with SNHD about a food establishment in either English or Spanish. If you believe that you became ill after eating at a location you can tap to file a Foodborne Illness Report. There’s also a link to call the SNHD Epidemiology Department. 

If you’re not feeling well it’s best to consult with your healthcare provider first and file your reports with SNHD later.
